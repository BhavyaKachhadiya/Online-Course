# Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme for software that conveys meaning about the underlying changes. It follows the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## Version Number Components

Given the example version: `^1.5.3`

- **1** represents the **Major Release**
- **5** represents the **Minor Release**
- **3** represents the **Patch Release**

### Major Release

- **Definition:** Significant changes that often include backward-incompatible changes.
- **Example:** Increasing the major version from 1 to 2, resulting in `2.0.0`.

### Minor Release

- **Definition:** Introduction of new features in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Example:** Increasing the minor version from 5 to 6, resulting in `1.6.0`.

### Patch Release

- **Definition:** Bug fixes and minor changes that do not affect the API or functionality.
- **Example:** Increasing the patch version from 3 to 4, resulting in `1.5.4`.

## The Caret (^) Symbol

The caret (`^`) symbol is used in version ranges to allow for more flexible dependency updates. It allows updates to all versions that do not modify the left-most non-zero digit. 

### Example: `^1.5.3`

- **Allows updates to:** Any version `>=1.5.3` and `<2.0.0`
- **Includes:** `1.5.4`, `1.6.0`, `1.7.0`, etc.
- **Excludes:** `2.0.0` or any higher major version.

### Usage in `package.json`

In your `package.json` file, you can specify dependency versions using the caret (`^`) to ensure compatibility with future minor and patch releases.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "example-package": "^1.5.3"
  }
}
```

## Summary

Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) provides a clear and consistent way to communicate changes in your software:

- **Major Release:** Significant changes, potentially breaking backward compatibility.
- **Minor Release:** New features, backward-compatible.
- **Patch Release:** Bug fixes, backward-compatible.

The **caret (^) symbol** allows for automatic updates to minor and patch versions while avoiding breaking changes from new major versions.

By following Semantic Versioning, you can better manage dependencies and ensure that your software evolves in a predictable and stable manner.
